# Requirements before using fix
IMPORTANT READ THE READ ME FILE INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD BEFORE USING THE FIX.

Watch the official fix guide video here on how to install the game and use the fix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTkDNoQrxhU&list=PLIkBjPwB07CTqLWUmpo1Pel6p7Pc4RlOZ&index=9&t=2s 

# Instructions
You must launch the game once before you use this fix. You will either need to start a new game or continue a save file and go to the video settings and make sure your resolution is 640 x 480 in order for the d3d9.dll file to work.

Go to releases, download the Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Fix that fits the requirements you need, then extract the d3d9.dll, d3d9.ini and the fps.dll files into your game folder next to the hp6.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Other Important Information
If you are a user where the FPS does not work correctly and is stuttery when putting in a cap or uncapping in the d3d9 ini file, then you must do the following.

Set the d3d9 ini file FPS cap to 0 so it is uncapped, then open your graphics control panel such as Nvidia Control Panel, go to Manage 3D options, Program settings, select HP6.exe file from drop down or browse and find it, set Low Latency Mode to Ultra, FPS to 278 and V-Sync to Fast then click apply.

Boot up the game and the FPS should now be fixed. This also fixes the mouse flying around the screen randomly.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio
The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080). Put the resolution that you wish to use in both Width and Height. If you boot up the game after setting the resolution you want in the d3d9.ini file and the resolution has not changed automatically then go to the video options menu in game and select your resolution from in there.

The default for aspect ratio is (0) which is (16:9). Choose the aspect ratio that is correct for you from the selection within the d3d9.ini file and replace (0) with the number correct for you.

# FPS
Choose one of the releases of either (60fps or up to 278fps) to use. If your monitor is 60hz then choose the 60fps release. If your monitor is 120hz or more choose the uncapped fps release.

# FOV
You can choose in the d3d9.ini file either 1, 2 or 3 each will zoom the FOV/camera in the game out slightly more. Choose which option you want to use, and it will be reflected in the game, 0 is off or original game cameras FOV.
